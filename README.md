# MNIST Classification with PyTorch

This repository contains a simple Python implementation using PyTorch for the classification of the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), widely used for training various image processing systems.

## Overview

The project aims to demonstrate a basic image classification pipeline using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. The model is a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) designed to classify handwritten digits.

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.10
- PyTorch
- matplotlib
- numpy

## Acknowledgments
 - The MNIST dataset was used in this project. More information about the dataset can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database and www.di.ens.fr/~lelarge/MNIST.tar.gz
